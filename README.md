# GPUGraphLayout-Timer
This repository contains a Bash script (`run_graph_viewer.sh`) that runs a graph layout program (`graph_viewer`) multiple times and measures the execution time for each run. It also calculates the average execution time after running the command a specified number of times (default is 10).
